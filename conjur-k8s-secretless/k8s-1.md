The kubernetes environment has been prepared for you.

If you got the following message on the right, that means kubernetes is starting.
It will take a minute or two.
```
master $ /usr/bin/launch.sh
Waiting for Kubernetes to start...
```

If it shows `Kubernetes started`, that means we're ready to proceed! &#128513;
